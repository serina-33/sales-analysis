# sales-analysis
A beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes simple sales data to find total sales, best-selling products, and monthly trends using Pandas and Matplotlib.

ðŸ›’ Sales Analysis Project

This project is a simple data analysis exercise using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
It helps beginners learn how to:

Analyze a sales dataset

Calculate total sales

Identify the best-selling product

Visualize sales trends over time

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The dataset includes information about:

OrderID â€” unique number for each order

Date â€” when the sale happened

Product â€” name of the item sold

UnitPrice â€” price per item

Quantity â€” number of items sold

From this data, we calculate:

Sales = UnitPrice Ã— Quantity

ðŸ§® What the Code Does

Imports required libraries (pandas, matplotlib)

Loads or creates a small sales dataset

Converts the Date column into a datetime format

Creates a new column called Sales

Calculates:

Total sales

Best-selling product

Groups data by month to find monthly sales trends

Visualizes results with bar and line charts

ðŸ“ˆ Example Output

Total Sales: $141.00

Best Product: Pen

Charts:

Bar chart showing sales by product

Line chart showing monthly sales trend

ðŸ§° Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas for data analysis

Matplotlib for visualization

(Optional) Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for running the code
